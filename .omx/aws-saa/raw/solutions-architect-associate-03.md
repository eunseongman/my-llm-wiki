## Introduction
<a name="solutions-architect-associate-03-intro"></a>

The [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) exam is intended for individuals who perform a solutions architect role. The exam validates a candidate's ability to design solutions based on the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

The exam also validates a candidate's ability to complete the following tasks:
+ Design solutions that incorporate AWS services to meet current business requirements and future projected needs
+ Design architectures that are secure, resilient, high-performing, and cost-optimized
+ Review existing solutions and determine improvements

## Target candidate description
<a name="solutions-architect-associate-03-target"></a>

The target candidate should have at least 1 year of hands-on experience designing cloud solutions that use AWS services.

## Exam content
<a name="solutions-architect-associate-03-exam-content"></a>

### Response types
<a name="solutions-architect-associate-03-response-types"></a>

There are two types of questions on the exam:
+ **Multiple choice:** Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors)
+ **Multiple response:** Has two or more correct responses out of five or more response options

Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Distractors, or incorrect answers, are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill might choose. Distractors are generally plausible responses that match the content area.

Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing. The exam includes 50 questions that affect your score.

### Unscored content
<a name="solutions-architect-associate-03-unscored-content"></a>

The exam includes 15 unscored questions that do not affect your score. AWS collects information about performance on these unscored questions to evaluate these questions for future use as scored questions. These unscored questions are not identified on the exam.

### Exam results
<a name="solutions-architect-associate-03-exam-results"></a>

The AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03) exam has a pass or fail designation. The exam is scored against a minimum standard established by AWS professionals who follow certification industry best practices and guidelines.

Your results for the exam are reported as a scaled score of 100–1,000. The minimum passing score is 720. Your score shows how you performed on the exam as a whole and whether you passed. Scaled scoring models help equate scores across multiple exam forms that might have slightly different difficulty levels.

Your score report could contain a table of classifications of your performance at each section level. The exam uses a compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to achieve a passing score in each section. You need to pass only the overall exam.

Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, so some sections have more questions than other sections have. The table of classifications contains general information that highlights your strengths and weaknesses. Use caution when you interpret section-level feedback.

# Mentions of AWS Services on the Exam
<a name="saa-service-mentions"></a>

AWS Certification is reducing the reading load on this exam by using official short names for well-known AWS service names that contain abbreviations or parenthetical information. For example, *Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)* appears on the exam as *Amazon SNS*.
+ The Help feature in the exam (available for every question) contains the list of the short AWS service names and their corresponding full names.
+ You can consult [AWS Service Names](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/policies/general-information/) on the AWS Certification website for the list of services that appear as their short names on the exam. Any services that are on the list but that are out of scope for the exam will not appear on the exam.

**Note:** Not every abbreviation is fully spelled out on the exam or available in the Help feature. The official full name for some AWS services includes an abbreviation that is never expanded (for example, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon EMR). The exam also might contain other abbreviations that the target audience is expected to know.

# In-scope AWS services and features
